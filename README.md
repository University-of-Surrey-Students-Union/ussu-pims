## Introduction
PIMS was initially developed as a primitive PHP 3 application for the University of Surrey Students' Union to manage asset tracking, inventory management and PAT testing.

The original application, while still in use, is no longer fit for purpose and is being redeveloped as this Spring application.

## Current Project Status
Adult life caught up with me after I graduated and I haven't had much time to work on this since. But, seeing as I'm so nice (and because people started bugging me), I'm now tidying everything up to get it ready for development again.

## Contributions
You can see the current issues in the backlog - I only use GitHub to track issues. If you're a CS student at the UoS/USSU/Surrey Stage Crew, you're more than welcome to contribute.
